## How it works

The python script should convert the MOCK_DATA.csv file into a Postgres table.

MOCK_DATA.csv is a csv file which has some missing data. The script should be able to handle the missing data and insert the data into the Postgres table.

The script should be able to run on any machine and should not require any manual intervention to run.

### Steps

1. Create a Postgres database
2. Create a table in the database using the csv file as a reference for the table structure
3. Clean the data and insert the data from the csv file into the postgres table
4. Update .env file with the connection details for the database (Note: You can use a local connection or a remote connection * if you are using a remote connection, please provide the connection details in the readme file)
5. Update requirements.txt file with the dependencies for the project
6. How would you improve the script to make it more efficient? (Note: You are not required to implement the improvements but list them in the readme file)
7. How you you ensure the script is running whenever the csv file is updated? (Note: You are not required to implement the improvements but list them in the readme file)
8. Upload the final project to github and provide the link to the repository


### Language to run script
   ``Python 3 + ``


### Deployment Notes
Once you have created a Postgres database, please update the requirements.txt file with the dependencies for the project.

You will upload the final project to github and provide the link to the repository.

#### Good luck!
