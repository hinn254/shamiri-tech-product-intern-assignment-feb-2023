#  code here  : please structure your code in a way that it is easy to read and understand

# Please read the following instructions carefully and follow them. They are important for the evaluation of your code.
# You are required to write a python script that will read the MOCK_DATA csv file and insert the data into a Postgres database.
# The script should be able to run on any machine and should not require any manual intervention to run.

### Steps:
# 1. Create a Postgres database
# 2. Create a table in the database using the csv file as a reference for the table structure
# 3. Clean the data and insert the data from the csv file into the postgres table 
# 4. Update .env file with the connection details for the database (Note: You can use a local connection or a remote connection * if you are using a remote connection, please provide the connection details in the readme file)
# 5. Update requirements.txt file with the dependencies for the project
# 6. How would you improve the script to make it more efficient? (Note: You are not required to implement the improvements but list them in the readme file)
# 7. How you you ensure the script is running whenever the csv file is updated? (Note: You are not required to implement the improvements but list them in the readme file)
# 8. Upload the final project to github and provide the link to the repository

# Path: script.py
